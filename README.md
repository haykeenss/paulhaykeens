Welcome to my GitHub profile. I’m a technology-focused builder and security enthusiast with hands-on experience across **cybersecurity**, **software development**, and **technical education**. I enjoy working at the intersection of *building systems* and *breaking them safely* to make them more secure, reliable, and scalable.

##  About Me

- 🔐 **Cybersecurity Researcher** with strong focus on offensive and defensive security
- 🧪 Per-time bughunter on **bug bounty programs** (Intigriti, Bugcrowd, HackerOne)
- 🛡️ Specialized in **Web Application Security** and real-world attack surfaces
- 💻 **Developer**: Web, mobile, automation, and scripting (Python/bash-focused)
- 🤖 **Robotics & Autonomous Systems** enthusiast (Arduino & embedded systems)
- 🎓 Founder of **HAYTECH OPs** (formerly HAYTECH Academy & Services)
- 🚀 Entrepreneurial, research-driven, and community-focused

I am particularly interested in identifying and responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities as regard top 10 OWASP such as **Broken Access Control**, **authentication and session flaws**, **IDOR**, **misconfigurations**, **XSS**, and **data exposure risks**, and translating findings into clear, actionable remediation guidance.
